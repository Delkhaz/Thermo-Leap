You need to open thermo_leap.cpp and edit the 4 strings read_temp, set_temp,
set_home, set_away. When you see %Structure_id%, %Device_id%, or %Access_key%
you need to replace it with your structure id, device id and access key. You
can acquire these through the REST walkthrough at https://developers.nest.com/documentation/cloud/rest-quick-guide/

A powerpoint and video is provided to show how to use the Leap Motion to control the Nest thermostat.

A makefile is provided to compile

Uses V2 of the leap motion SDK
